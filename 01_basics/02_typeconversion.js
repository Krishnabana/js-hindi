let score = "33fc"
let sc = Number(score)

// we can only convert the type of data but can't convert its actually valye in this case
console.log(typeof sc);
console.log(sc);

/* some of examples are:- 
33 => 33
"33fc" => NaN (not a number)
"true" => 1 or false => 0 and also 1 as true and 0 as false when we convert num to bool
"" (empty string) => false
and if we convert number to string that it is converted easily
33 => 33 (but its type is string)
